A Data Analytics project analyzes the correlation with retail sales for pool products, including data imputation for missing values and trend visualization.

The analysis is based on historical temperature records, spanning from 2017 to August 2025. Data from 2017 and 2018 was leveraged to support the imputation of missing temperature values in early 2020 and to generate a robust forecast for the final months of 2025.

This project is for training and demonstration purposes only.

## This is the first step of th project, the next one will be published as soon as possible.
